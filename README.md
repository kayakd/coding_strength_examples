## Coding Strength Examples

This repository contains curated examples of strong, efficient, and well-structured code across multiple programming languages, fun codes and bioinformatics use cases. Each folder demonstrates problem-solving skills, code clarity, and real-world utility, aimed at showcasing technical depth across different domains.

## Folder Structure
- `/python` – Data science, automation, and bioinformatics hacks using `pandas`, `NumPy`, `requests`, `matplotlib`, and more
- `/R` – Statistical modeling, ggplot visualizations, Seurat pipelines, and rapid biological data analyses
- `/Bash` – Minimalist and powerful shell scripts for HPC clusters, file wrangling, and pipeline execution
- `/Java` – Object-oriented micro-projects: parsers, data structures, backend logic, and algorithm demos
- `/Notebooks` – Interactive explorations and data narratives in Jupyter (Python) or RMarkdown

## Highlights

- Emphasis on code readability and performance
- Cross-platform examples tailored to bioinformatics and data-intensive fields
- Each script is standalone, modular, and documented
- Wherever possible, includes both a basic and optimized version of the same task

## Why This Repo?

As a bioinformatics scientist working at the intersection of large-scale genomics and software development, I use this space to:
- Archive reusable code
- Demonstrate language-agnostic problem solving
- Help collaborators and recruiters evaluate practical coding ability
