## My Projects at a glance

This repository contains a curated set of tools and scripts I developed for practical use in bioinformatics, data analysis, and systems-level automation. Built using Python, Bash, R, Java, and Jupyter environments, these resources demonstrate efficient solutions to real-world challenges in biological data workflows.
## download_gse

[Download FASTQ files from GEO (Bash)](https://github.com/kayakd/kdk_bioinformatics_tools/tree/main/Bash/download_gse)  
  A Bash script to automatically retrieve FASTQ files using a GEO Series accession (GSE ID).  
  It fetches the SRA metadata, extracts SRR run IDs, and downloads FASTQs via `prefetch` and `fasterq-dump`.

## Hi-C Multi-Omics Visualization Tool

A browser-based interactive tool for visualizing Hi-C data alongside other omics datasets.

Access it here:  
[https://kayakd.github.io/kdk_bioinformatics_tools/hic_viz_tool/viz.htm](https://kayakd.github.io/kdk_bioinformatics_tools/hic_viz_tool/viz.htm)

Tool location in repo:  
[`/hic_viz_tool`](hic_viz_tool/)

## Folder Structure

- `/python` – Data science, automation, and bioinformatics hacks using `pandas`, `NumPy`, `requests`, `matplotlib`, and more
- `/R` – Statistical modeling, ggplot visualizations, Seurat pipelines, and rapid biological data analyses
- `/Bash` – Minimalist and powerful shell scripts for HPC clusters, file wrangling, and pipeline execution
- `/Java` – Object-oriented micro-projects: parsers, data structures, backend logic, and algorithm demos
- `/Notebooks` – Interactive explorations and data narratives in Jupyter (Python) or RMarkdown
- `/hic_viz_tool` – Static visualization interface for Hi-C and multi-omics integration

## Highlights

- Emphasis on code readability and performance
- Cross-platform examples tailored to bioinformatics and data-intensive fields
- Each script is standalone, modular, and documented
- Wherever possible, includes both a basic and optimized version of the same task

## Why This Repo?

As a bioinformatics scientist working at the intersection of large-scale genomics and software development, I use this space to:
- Archive reusable code
- Demonstrate language-agnostic problem solving
- Help collaborators and recruiters evaluate practical coding ability
